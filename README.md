very simple online DJI-SRT data viewer

This is my own DJI SRT data viewer, the parser is fully adopted from https://github.com/JuanIrache/dji-srt-viewer (thanks to you all).
However due to the different nature between their nodejs based and browser based javascript, I had to made some modification in order to accomodate this browser environment.

# How to Use
- Open the link below
